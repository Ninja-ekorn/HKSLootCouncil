## Install: ##
- Download zip, rename "HKSLootCouncil-main" to "HKSLootCouncil" and place on your addons folder.


## Description: ##
- The addon uses the lua file called LCTable.lua to read entries and match name of bosses, loot tables and other items, such a trash loot drops.
- When you start looting, the addon scans all drops for matches in the table, and if it finds it, it puts the item in a frame/window, along with the top 5 people on the LC list for that item. The master looter can then click any of the player names to give the item directly.
